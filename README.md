# grading_scripts
This contains scripts that I use to improve the grading workflow for myself. It's pretty hyper specific to how what I use imports/ handles mass zipped files so it may not be helpful for anyone else but I'd rather share a git link over a file via discord so here we are!

Also feel free to critique/add suggestions!
